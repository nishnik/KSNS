Most common applications are in minimizing effort or cost, and maximizing output. Optimization Techniques are divided into two different types, namely Linear Models and Non-Linear Models. The mathematical statement of a linear model is stated as follows:\n\nFind <math> x_1, x_2, x_3,..., x_n </math> so as to\n\n<math>max/min : Z = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} c_j x_j, j=1,2,3...n </math>\n\nSubject to the conditions : \n\n<math>\\sum_{j=0}^{n} a_{ij} x_j (\\le,=,\\ge) b_i, i=1,2,3...m </math> \n\n<math> x_j\\ge0, j=1,2,3,...,n</math>\n\n===Graphical Method===\n===Basic Feasible Solution Method===\n===Simplex Method===\n===Big-M Method===\n===Two Phase Method===\n===Dual Simplex Method===\n===Theorems===\n\n=Classroom resources=\n=Suggested reference books=\n=Additional Resources=\n[[Category:Courses]]

The option to take this course comes first in sixth semester for Computer Science students, of which most of them enroll (96+ in a batch of 110). The lab component consists of 2 individual assignments and 2 group assignments, which are a great learning experience where you create something of potential value. The exams are relatively easy to score and given the scores, the number of Ex's and A's are not few. The exams mostly require to write boolean equations or draw decision trees.

Furthermore, there was a huge weightage on attendance, he definitely took attendance for the 8 AM classes and discarded the attendance if the class strength was more than 50%. He tries to fit a normal curve on the marks distribution for grading. This means that only 2-3 students get EX, but no one gets F too, and most of the class ends up getting B or C grade. No books were specified. The best thing was labwork (It carried attendance). That was the best learning experience.

Most of the course is based on Estimation theory and Prof. Anirban teaches it exactly as is from Steven Kay's SSP book. Estimation theory is mainly about inferering the parameters (population parameters) from a set of observable data and infering the parameters that influence their occuring. As the course under Anirban follows the book completely, it is really easy and straightforward to learn. SSP is a very fun course where one can expect to strengthen one's knowledge on Probablity and Signal Processing together. Prof. Anirban rarely talked about examples in real life where SSP can be of use, but the book does a very fine job in exposing the applications. \n\n-- Arun Patro (EE '18)\n\n===How to Crack the Paper===\nThe mid-semester paper is usually easy and covers simple concepts taught in class in the form of sums. There are a few derivation based questions in the paper as well which can be found in the example section of the chapters covered in the Steven M. Kay. It is advisable to go through the sums given in the class as assignment problems. It is also recommended to get hold of the previous year question paper from a senior as it is not available in the library website. Some problem patterns can be inferred from them, which helps in narrowing down the focus of preparation. The mid-semester paper is usually scoring.\n\nThere is a single class test held which has a weightage of  10 marks and the other 10 marks comes from the assignment submission. The class test is usually tricky which tests some basic concepts and the pattern of sums set are not available in the book. The end-semester paper consists of 6 questions of 10 marks each. Adequate time is available to complete the paper. Revising the assignment sums and previous year paper is useful. It is advisable to thoroughly revise the example sums from the Steven M. Kay for the portions which has been added new to the syllabus compared to previous years.\n\n=Classroom resources=\n\n=Additional Resources=\n# An Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing Volume I (Estimation Theory) by Steven M.

With\nthe rising demand to secure energy sources particularly at low prices there is\na competition for resources. Global, social, economic and environment goals of\nsustainability cannot be achieved if energy security is not achieved. The\nInternational Energy Agency forecasts that the world primary energy demand will\ngrow by 1.6 percent per year on average in 2006-2030. Rising energy needs has\nalways been a major concern in India’s growth endeavor and energy security is\ngoing to be one of the most crucial economic and strategic policy challenges\nfor India in the next few decades, especially with an additional goal of\nfollowing a low carbon growth path. With increased economic growth, changing\nlifestyle and increase in energy intensity in the economy, ensuring reliable\nand cheap supply of clean energy to the Indian economy will be a difficult\ntask. A recent report by World Economic Forum, tried to estimate the challenges\nfaced by countries to achieve energy security in a sustainable way. According\nto this study, India is ranked 98th among 124 countries in terms of providing\nenergy security and access to its citizens. To ensure an acceptable level of\nenergy consumption for everyone, the overall availability ofenergy would need\nto be increasedsubstantially.Renewable energy resources are an important\nconsideration which offer a chance for reduced carbon 4emissions, cleaner air\nand a more sustainable use of earth resources. Technology options like\ncogeneration have become more important. Energy governance plays an important\nrole in standardization. Decision trees, regulatory considerations and\nsustainability criteria help in achieving good governance in transportation\nsector and other end use sectors. There is active engagement of governments in\nadapting international policy in domestic front and developing better\nregulatory and pricing structures in the energy markets. Objective of the\nCourse: a. The course will equip students to understand the ongoing\ntechnological, policy and implementation aspects related to different forms of\nenergy used worldwide. b. A critical understanding on the development of\nnational policies and technology deployment vis a vis economics of energy. c.\nUnderstanding interdisciplinary aspects of policy and socio-economic contexts\nin energy commercialization worldwide d. Understanding factors related to\ngeopolitical stability, geographical accessibility and underdeveloped\ninternational as well as domestic energy markets Teaching- Learning\nMethodology: The method of teaching-learning such a course on Energy: Policy\nand Governance has to maximize the (1) information package (2) provide an\ninterdisciplinary focus into the multiple considerations of implementing energy\ntechnologies from a technical, policy and governance perspective. A combination\nof lectures, interactive exercises, assignments, case studies will form the\nmethod of teaching-learning. Student will learn about the different energy\n\n�types, their production and policy influences on energy use and development,\ngovernance and regulation. 5The course may facilitate one visit to the nearest\nenergy unit/WBREDA implementing units to enable students to practically\nunderstand related to policy support, compliance requirements and certain\naspects of energy commercialization.\n\n\n==Concepts taught in class==\n\n===Student Opinion===\n\n==How to Crack the Paper==\n\n=Classroom resources=\n\n=Additional Resources=\n[[Category:School of Energy Science & Engineering]][[Category:Courses]]\n[[Category:School of Energy Science & Engineering]][[Category:Courses]]

This paradigm emphasizes on the\nintegration of data, knowledge, and tools necessary for efficient knowledge\ndiscovery in the decision-making process associated with information extraction\nand computational intelligence. The aim of this course is to present an\noverview of different methods used in biomedical signal processing. Signals\nwith bioelectric origin are given special attention and their properties and\nclinical significance are reviewed. In many cases, the methods used for\nprocessing and analyzing biomedical signals are derived from a modeling\nperspective based on statistical signal descriptions. The purpose of the signal\nprocessing methods ranges from reduction of noise and artifacts to extraction\nof clinically significant features. The course gives each participant the\nopportunity to study the performance of a method on real, biomedical signals.\nIt covers principles and algorithms for processing both deterministic and\nrandom signals.
